* Argparse - https://github.com/ThomasWaldmann/argparse/blob/master/LICENSE.txt


argparse is (c) 2006-2009 Steven J. Bethard <steven.bethard@gmail.com>.

The argparse module was contributed to Python as of Python 2.7 and thus
was licensed under the Python license. Same license applies to all files in
the argparse package project.

For details about the Python License, please see doc/Python-License.txt.

History
-------

Before (and including) argparse 1.1, the argparse package was licensed under
Apache License v2.0.

After argparse 1.1, all project files from the argparse project were deleted
due to license compatibility issues between Apache License 2.0 and GNU GPL v2.

The project repository then had a clean start with some files taken from
Python 2.7.1, so definitely all files are under Python License now.
